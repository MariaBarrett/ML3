#Just run it as is

Required modules:
-----------------

Numpy
Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
Pylab

-------------------------------------

Running the program:
--------------------

Initialize the main.py from your
terminal or preferred IDE.

Be mindful that running the NN is
time consuming since it requires
you to train the network on the data
before predicting. 
It also set to run with 20 hidden
neurons, but this can be changed in
nn.py .
